# <span style="color: #f7931e;">Getting Started with Credeau SDK</span>

**Credeau SDK** is a powerful SDK designed for seamless integration into lender-facing mobile apps or web platforms. It enables secure data exchange and delivers predictive analytics to support smart, data-driven lending decisions.

## <span style="color: #f7931e;">Integration Overview</span>

To start using Credeau SDK, the setup involves **two primary stages**:

---

### 1. Frontend SDK Integration

This phase involves embedding the Credeau SDK into your client-facing application — whether it's on Android, iOS, or the Web — to facilitate a secure and frictionless data sharing experience.

Credeau SDK supports a wide range of platforms:

| Platform / Framework | Use Case                       | Documentation         |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Android**          | Native Android application     | [Android Guide](#)     |
| **React Native**     | Cross-platform mobile integration | [React Native Guide](#) |
| **Flutter**          | Cross-platform integration     | [Flutter Guide](#)     |
| **iOS**              | Native iOS application         | [iOS Guide](#)         |
| **Web**              | Browser-based application integration | [Web Guide](#)         |

Detailed instructions and code samples are available in each platform-specific guide.

### 2. Backend Integration with Insights API

After successfully integrating the frontend SDK, the next step is to leverage the **Insights API** — the gateway to actionable intelligence.

This API enables your backend systems to retrieve meaningful, prediction-ready data points based on the information shared via the SDK. These predictors help assess risk, enhance underwriting, and make well-informed lending decisions.
